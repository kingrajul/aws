For AWS S3 reference [S3 bucket policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html).

## Security 
S3 Buckets can be secured in the following manner:

* Bucket Policy 
* Principal/IAM policy 

### Default settings 
* ACL - Only creater account has read/write access 
* Bucket Poicy - No Policy by default. If there is no bucket policy, there is full access within the account. 
* IAM Policy - No Policy by default. A policy is required for a principle or service to access the S3 bucket. 

* IP Restriction - Specified IP 
* A principal with specific tag/specified value (used for principles running outside of the VPC, such as out of VPC lambda function)
* Specific VPC endpoint 
* Specific VPCs
